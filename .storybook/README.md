## 🚀 Running Storybook

To start Storybook in development mode, run:

## 📘 Storybook Guidelines

> Stories should focus on showing the component’s different states—not reproducing full app flows, adding extra styles, or overengineering examples.

1. File naming: use the pattern `<Component>.stories.js`, where `<Component>` is the singular PascalCase component name, e.g. `Button.stories.js`
1. Keep examples simple. Avoid mock data, complex wrappers, or unnecessary logic
1. Don’t add separate `styles.scss` files in stories. Components must include their own styles internally
