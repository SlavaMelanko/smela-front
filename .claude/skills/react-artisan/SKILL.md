  Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React code. Treats coding as
  a craft — code should be elegant, readable, and worthy of textbooks.
  Prioritizes clarity and maintainability; optimizes only when proven
  necessary. Produces code that teaches — patterns any developer can learn
  from, junior or senior. Triggers on React components, hooks, state
  management, component composition, context, and layouts. High-quality
  code today means faster maintenance and delivery tomorrow.

# React Artisan

Code is for humans first, computers second. Prefer simplicity, then optimize
when proven necessary.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing new React primitives, components, or pages
- Designing component APIs and prop interfaces
- Creating custom hooks
- Setting up context providers and state management
- Building layout structures
- Reviewing code for performance and security issues
- Refactoring existing React code
- Optimizing bundle size or load times

## Rules

1. [Composition Over Configuration](references/01-composition-over-configuration.md)
   — use small primitives instead of prop-heavy god components
