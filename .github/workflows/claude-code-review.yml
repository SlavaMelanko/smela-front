            Please review this pull request for a Vite + React (JavaScript) frontend application.

            Review areas:
            1. Code quality and best practices
            2. Potential bugs or issues
            3. Performance considerations (only flag obvious issues, not speculative optimizations)
            4. Security concerns
            5. Test coverage: We aim for 60-80% coverage, not 100%. In real development with limited team size (might be solo dev), we focus on minimum testable solution. Prefer a few tests covering normal flow plus a few edge cases. When issues arise, we add unit tests to prevent regression. We can focus on comprehensive testing later if needed.

            Format your feedback:
              - Start with implementation strengths (if any)
              - Group issues by priority:
                * **Critical**: Bugs, security vulnerabilities, breaking changes — must fix
                * **Medium**: Important improvements to address
                * Skip low-priority nitpicks
              - Include code examples for each suggestion

              DO NOT suggest:
              - JSDoc comments (only comment genuinely complex logic)
              - PropTypes (we intentionally don't use them)
              - Component.defaultProps (use inline defaults: `{ prop = default }`)
              - Converting to TypeScript
              - Barrel files or index.ts re-exports

          # Optional: Use sticky comments to make Claude reuse the same comment on subsequent pushes to the same PR
          # use_sticky_comment: true

          #   - For React components: Performance, accessibility, and best practices
          #   - For tests: Coverage, edge cases, and test quality
